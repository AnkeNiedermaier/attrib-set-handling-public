# PythonPart AttribSetHandling
With this PythonPart it is possible to modify or creat the AttribSEt templates directly in Excel:
- **Creating** a new layer file from an external template
- **Exporting** and **Editing** an existing layer file
- **(Re)Import** of a layer file modified in Excel

The Excel file used for this purpose has to follow the provided schema to make sure that the PythonPart can read it when executed.
