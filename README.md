# PythonPart AttribSetHandling
With this PythonPart it is possible to work on the Allplan AttributesetTemplates directly in Excel. It offers different possibilities:
- **Creating** a new layer file from an external template
- **Exporting** and **Editing** an existing layer file
- **(Re)Import** of a layer file modified in Excel

The functionalities are possible both for single or a number of AttribSets.
