# PythonPart AttribSetHandling
Since several Allplan versions it is possible to group attributes individually and assign them more or less automatically to selected objects in using so called **AttributsetTemplates** which are part of the project settings. With this PythonPart it is possible to edit them directly in Excel. It offers different options:
- **Creating** a new layer file from an external template
- **Exporting** and **Editing** an existing layer file
- **(Re)Import** of a layer file modified in Excel

This is possible both for single or a whole bunch of AttributSets.

## Installation
The PythonPart **AttribSetHandling** can be installed directly from the Plugin Manager in ALLPLAN. 

Alternatively, the corresponding ***.allep** package can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/AnkeNiedermaier/attrib-set-handling-public/releases). ***.allep** files are ALLPLAN internal setups that can be installed via drag and drop into the program window.

At least the version 2026 is needed to install the PythonPart.

## Installed PythonPart Scripts
If the installation was successfull, the PythonPart **AttribSetHandling.pyp** can be found
in the ALLPLAN Library:
`Office` → `ALLPLAN GmbH` → `AttribSetHandling`
